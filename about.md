I am the Master Of None! I have a little bit of knowledge on a lot of topics. I have gone to school for civil engineering, basic/digital/advanced electronics and have a Bachelor's in Science majoring in computer science and minoring in management information systems. I have served a 6000 hour apprenticeship as a bricklayer and in the trowel trades. I have been playing guitar for a long, long time. I am a saltwater aquarium hobbyist. I enjoy golf. 

If that's not enough, I come from a time from way, way back when you had to know how to change a tire alongside the road. A time when you could repair a car with a cheap socket set and a handful of wrenches. I have repaired small motors. I have done rough and finished carpentry. My friends, I think that I have done it all. 

Of course, I was able to master the following along the way...nothing! Again - I know a little about a lot. So why should you follow me or take my advice? I guess you really don't have to. But I have learned along the way. I have found common pitfalls that accompany projects, as well as making some unbelievably stupid mistakes along the way. I was able to work through them and finish (most of) these projects. If I can help you avoid these pitfalls and mistakes, as well as give you some pointers and ideas, maybe this blog is worth checking out. 

Just saying.

Anyway, please take a look around and let me know what you think. Please interact. If I am doing something wrong, let me know. If there is something that you would like to know more about, ask me. I may just have some helpful advice. You never know.
