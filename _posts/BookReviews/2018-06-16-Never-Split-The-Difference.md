I finished reading the book "Never Split the Difference - Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on it" by Chris Voss, then I read it again. It was that good. Chris Voss is the former FBI lead international kidnapping negotiator. He knows his stuff.

Throughout the book, he talks about different techniques that he has learned and developed in negotiating. These techniques include "mirroring," "labeling," "mastering no," and finding what he calls "the black swan." What are these techniques, exactly? You'll have to read the book!

I will say that the chapter that really made me look at negotiating in a different way was the one on mastering "No." It is kind of funny. You think that the whole goal of a negotiation is to get the other side to say "yes." Voss disagrees. It is a simple, yet subtle idea - getting the other party to say yes makes them feel as if you are directing the negotiation - they know that you want them to say yes. If you give them a reason to say no, it makes them feel as if they are directing the negotiation, therefore they are more likely to agree to your terms if they believe that they had arrived at those terms themselves.

You can turn any question around to get to no. For example, instead of asking "Don’t you think that I am worth an increase in pay?" you may ask "Am I doing a poor job? If not, is there someone more deserving?" Always direct the conversation to no. If that goes sideways, you can use Voss' other techniques to get back on track. It seems simple, but I have to say that I have been playing around with this technique here and there with positive results.

Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Voss goes into so much more than my little example, and much more clearly. My poor example doesn’t do this book justice.  Put simply, if you would like to have a good idea on how to develop a game-plan for negotiating - read this book. I really did enjoy it and I really did read it twice. 

Did you read "Never Split the Difference - Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on it" by Chris Voss? How did you like the book? Please let me know in the comments below.
