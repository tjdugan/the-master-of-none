"Ready?" asked our company's VP. "Ready," I responded. I followed him into the job trailer where we met with the project manager and superintendent. We exchanged the usual pleasantries and then got down to business. My VP said "You know, we had given you a quote for the air barrier on this project at bid time." "I know" replied the project manager "but your price was not in line with the other sub's price." Yet, there we stood.

We were there to offer our services to finish and repair the air barrier (partially) installed by another subcontractor. That sub was from out of town and had packed up and left, refusing to return. They had gotten in over their heads and left the GC high and dry. As we walked through remaining scope, I couldn't help but feel a little bad about the additional money that this was going to cost them. It ended up costing them more in the long run. They knew it, we knew it, and my VP let them know it.

We came in, repaired the work, and finished the air barrier on schedule. Another one in the books. It just didn't have to be so difficult.

That was a few years ago now. Since that time, I have been answering all the same questions and facing all the same problems with air barrier. "Why is your price X? It seems awfully high." "Who owns the silicone sheet extrusions? The glass guy didn't carry it."

There seems to be a lack of true understanding of the air barrier systems in general. This is no surprise with so many different systems, so many different products available. Non-permeable, Vapor permeable, Bithumious, Non-bituminous, Silicone, Sheet, Fluid-Applied, Aluminum-Faced, NFPA 285 Compliant, etc. There are so many different accessories, different methods for treating transitions, tie-ins, and openings.

That's why whe have the job-specific specification, right? The only problem with that is that it is probably a generic spec. 

## What is ABAA?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server.

Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free.
